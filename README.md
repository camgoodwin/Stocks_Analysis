# Stocks_Analysis
Refactoring stock analysis code to review a larger data set at a faster speed
## Overview of Project
We are refactoring the code in order to run the same analysis at a faster speed.  The purpose of restructuring code is to make the code more efficient and easier to understand.  Within a refactored code there are more comments explaining the transitions and changes that were made.   
## Results
By refactoring the code we were able to create the results for the analysis at a faster speed for both 2017 and 2018.  With this code we are able to run the code easily for any year as we used the yearValue function.  In the previous code we had to change the year for each part of the code in order to obtain results.     
## Summary 
We are now able to use this code on larger sets of data knowing that it will take less time than our previous code. The new code has more logical statements that easily allow us to read the code and make any quick changes.  
### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
The advantage of refactoring code is that the basic structure for the code is already created.  Another advantage is we are able to focus primarily on the logic in order to make it perform successfuly.  The disadvanage to refactoring code is determining which aspects to change to make the code more efficient.  By trying to narrow the focus of the code you in turn can add too many aspects VBA needs to run.   
### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script? 
The original VBA script had less conditional statements allowing for a straight forward approach.  In the refactoring by adding additional logic statements it took a longer amount of time to create the code.  Although it took longer to create this code, every time this code runs it will be able to run through large amounts of data quickly.
